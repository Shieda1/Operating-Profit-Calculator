    Insert the information in the form and the calculator will determine the operating profit<br> 
    What is the operating profit?<br>
    the operating profit of a firm is it's total earnings from it's core business functions for a specific period of time without the deduction of interest, taxes and any earnings from other businesses that the firm has a part interest in. It is also called operating income.<br>
    How to calculate operating profit?<br>
    To calculate operating profit you should use the following formula:<br>
    operating profit = gross profit -operating expenses<br>
    where:<br>
    gross profit = revenue - cost of goods sold<br>
    example: A company sold $63,000 worth of products and it cost the company $11,000 to provide these products and it also pay $4,000 on rent and electricity, calculate the operating profit:<br>
    first we should calculate the gross profit:<br>
    gross profit = revenue - cost of goods sold<br>
    gross profit = $63,000 - $11,000<br>
    gross profit = $52,000<br>
    and now let's calculate the operating profit:<br>
    operating profit = gross profit - operating expensess<br>
    operating profit = $52,000 - $4,000<br>
    operating profit = $48,000<br>
    Why use operating profit?<br>
    the operating profit is used because it is a good indicator of a business's health because it removes any irrelevant factor from the calcualtion and only takes into account the expenses that are necessary to keep the business running.<br>
